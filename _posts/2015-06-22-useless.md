###### Milk + [Malcolm Jack](https://malcolmjack.bandcamp.com/) + [Kim Gray](https://kimgray.bandcamp.com/) + [Soft Haze](https://softhaze.bandcamp.com/) - 18 June 2015 (Thurs.) at 303 Columbia

It was the first time it rained here in a month, so that scared people away, but I still got there early to support my [happy hour radio](https://www.mixcloud.com/happyhourradioshow/) pals and the bands. Soft Haze and Kim Gray both sounded great, but their sounds are too loud for my liking. The highlight was when [Queen L Ray](http://laurenjray.com/) sang [Background](https://softhaze.bandcamp.com/track/background) with Soft Haze. I couldn't hear her voice very well, but it was really fun to see her putting her arms behind her back, swinging a bit from side to side, and singing as best as she could. Malcolm Jack was awesome. His set was on the shorter side of all the sets, and most of it was songs by Dada Plan. He didn't play my recent favourite [The Madness Hides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mq2FtePogg), but it was refreshing to hear the solo versions of their tunes, and I love how high he holds up his guitar. Milk's set was unfortunately cut short, but I like the new project from the former [Watermelon](https://watermelon.bandcamp.com/track/hell-mouth). I cannot remember any of their set right now, but I know I will get excited once they have more music/web presence. Most importantly, are they playing Ray Fest?

###### [Woolworm](https://woolworm.bandcamp.com/track/useless) + [Slam Dunk](https://slamdunk.bandcamp.com/) + [Whitney K](https://whitneyk.bandcamp.com/) + [Blockhead](https://blockheadvan.bandcamp.com/) - 19 June 2015 (Fri.) at the Astoria

I got to the Astoria for the first time and on time for Whitney K's set. It was lovely to see so many people show up to this gig, but it wasn't a great show overall for me. All three sets were way too loud, and I can't recall any special moments other than Woolworm playing [Useless](https://woolworm.bandcamp.com/track/useless) and seeing a lot of my friends. That being said, it would be good for me to check out Woolworm more at another venue with better sound.

###### [Fountain](http://fountain.bandcamp.com/track/emerald-dripping-flat) + [Other Jesus](https://otherjesus.bandcamp.com/) + [Whitney K](https://whitneyk.bandcamp.com/) + Somatic - 20 June 2015 (Sat.) at Black Lab

I was more stoked about seeing Fountain the next day the whole time at the Astoria the night before, and they blew me away again even with the more than the usual number of technical issues. Their set was mostly from their latest album [Fountain 2](http://fountain.bandcamp.com/album/fountain-2-2) as before at the Hindenburg during Music Waste 2015. It was a bit unfortunate that their bassist had to stand off the small stage at Black Lab, but I was super happy to be <del>dancing</del> conducting (Someone told me this after the show.) the entire set. Fountain are the best of the 2015 Canadian post-punk scene for me. They are the hidden gem of the Pacific Northwest right now. Basically, go see them if you have not! Other Jesus are being buzzed in the scene right now, and I was happy to check them out for the first time. They have a darker, louder post-punk sound, and I had not listened to their music before. I enjoyed their set for the most part, but I think I need to listen to their music more. Whitney K were pleasantly and surprisingly good, because they were softer than they were the night before, and they performed better. I spoke to their lead after, and he agreed. I think I have seen them play four times now? It was definitely their best set of the four sets.
