###### [Only Wolf](https://kingfisherbluez.bandcamp.com/album/chemicals) + [Holy Hum](https://kingfisherbluez.bandcamp.com/album/appendix-a-b) + [Tim The Mute](https://kingfisherbluez.bandcamp.com/track/mushy-peas) - 20 May 2015 (Wed.) at Skinny Fat Jack's

Skinny Fat Jack's is a cute space located in Riley Park. It gives Bushwick vibes but is way too hot for like a cafe/pub/resto show on a Wednesday night during the summer. Anyway, I got to catch Holy Hum and Tim The Mute. Tim is a fun guy who plays fun songs. I've only seen two of his solo sets, but they are perfect for an evening at a pub. Holy Hum played an awesome ambient drone set, but it was putting me to sleep, unfortunately. I had been meaning to see him live but didn't expect to see him with Tim The Mute. Holy Hum would be amazing for like a drone sleepover night and/or on Drone Day. Why did he not play on National Drone Day?

###### [The Good In Everyone](https://thegoodineveryone.bandcamp.com/track/skip-down-the-stairs) + [Alea Rae](https://alearae.bandcamp.com/track/flies) + Alexandria Maillot + Dante Hadden - 21 May 2015 (Thurs.) at the Fox

I rarely go to shows without listening to much of the music on the bill, but this was a 'the night before and the day of' decision. After chills at Jon Rogers Park (Did I tell you my new favourite nickname is Eubezie?), we were on time for Alea Rae. Alea Rae are 1,000 percent better than [Daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QT5eGHCJdE) and BC! Jer, the drummer, blew my mind in a way that Daughter did not when I saw them two summers ago back in Montr√©al. The Good In Everyone were also great. I think they're similar to [Said The Whale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PfwGwQic1c) but better. If you are located east of Vancouver, you can catch the two bands on their [Canadian tour](http://thegoodineveryone.ca/tour/)!

###### [Real Estate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU50_Z4KgA8) + [Woods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV31xV2PA1I) - 22 May 2015 (Fri.) at the Imperial

Real Estate played sold out Il Motore (now [Bar Le Ritz PDB](http://barleritzpdb.com/)) in March last year, but I didn't buy my ticket in advance, so I had to wait another year. This time, I bought my ticket over two months in advance. I was prepared to go. In the few weeks leading up to the night, however, a couple of great local shows got announced for the same night, and I started having second thoughts. But, I was reassured when Queen told me, "touring bands over local bands!". There were too many Chads, and beers were on the expensive side of the scale, but Woods s h r e d d e d, and I sapped hard with Real Estate. The PBRs at SBC after the show made up for the one beer I had at the Imperial. Oh, John on [Quilt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-V17nF6UcI&feature=youtu.be&t=12s) and Woods, and I talked about [Casa del Popolo](http://casadelpopolo.com/) and the upcoming release of Quilt's third full length!
