###### [Peace](https://peacevancouver.bandcamp.com/album/my-face) + [Glad Rags](https://gladragsband.bandcamp.com/) + SBDC + Terror Bird - 4 June 2015 (Thurs.) at SBC (Music Waste 2015)

I finally got to see Peace live. I was pretty stoked, since I had been listening to their music since last fall and missed them a few times. I didn't recognize any of the songs during their set, which probably means that they were all new. I wasn't disappointed with their set, but I found that I like their older stuff more than their new stuff. Oh well. It was also an all-ages show with no beer, and I was by myself. I thought SBC was cool for a show, though.

###### Needs + [Fountain](http://fountain.bandcamp.com/track/high-strung-on-zen) + [Soft Haze](http://softhaze.bandcamp.com/) + [Les Chaussettes](http://leschaussettes.bandcamp.com/) + Shawn Mrazek Lives! + Digital Houdini - 4 June 2015 (Thurs.) at the Hindenburg (Music Waste 2015)

Holy Fountain shit, they were amazing! For me, they were better than [Freak Heat Waves](https://freakheatwaves.bandcamp.com/track/bonnies-state-of-mind) who were better than [Viet Cong](https://open.spotify.com/track/7rqZJ8JM8nlNHb4p8eCSTR). It was the best Music Waste set for me (of the sets I saw over the long weekend). I didn't love the new Fountain album when it came out last week, but I've been sold after seeing them live and listening to the album more and more. There is so much going on in their music, yet they sound very polished and energetic. Fountain's drummer was especially exciting to watch, and I enjoyed dancing with their friends, including my roommate. I can't wait to see them headline Black Lab next weekend!

###### [The Backhomes](https://thebackhomesband.bandcamp.com/) + [Supermoon](http://allmoonsaresuper.bandcamp.com/track/tragedy) + wild/kind + [Revered](https://soundcloud.com/emmett-hall-revered) + Still Creek Murder - 5 June 2015 (Fri.) at ANZA Club (Music Waste 2015)

It was between this and [Woolworm](http://woolworm.bandcamp.com/track/useless) + [Energy Slime](http://jayarner.bandcamp.com/album/new-dimensional) + The Blessed Pissers + Amos Hertzman at Pat's Pub, but I wanted to see Supermoon more, since I missed their tape release show last weekend. Supermoon are the new [(The) Courtneys](https://thecourtneys.bandcamp.com/track/90210-2) for me. Tragedy live was great, and I really like their merchandise/theme. As they say, all moons are super. Revered were awesome and really funny. Apparently, the frontman Emmett Hall is in [The Sunday Service](http://www.foxcabaret.com/calendar), so I'll have to check that out at some point.

###### [Tobacco](https://open.spotify.com/track/43G33jY3949ilzpR7DOmLY) + [Shigeto](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Hptzj8cBMnD6TdUfyipul) + [Blackbird Blackbird](https://blackbirdblackbird.bandcamp.com/track/tangerine-sky) + Al Lover - 6 June 2015 (Sat.) at the Rickshaw (Levitation Vancouver)

SHIGETO-SAN! I had a feeling he'd be better than when I saw him open for [Tycho](https://soundcloud.com/tycho/tycho-awake) back in March, because I knew that the Rickshaw crowd would be better, and I'd be right at the stage. I was right! Shigeto was superb. He played _and_ sweat (literally) his heart out. I love that he plays with a full drum set and wish he isn't as underrated. I would definitely go see him again. Tobacco was almost as awesome, but there was something off about the sound quality. I couldn't hear his voice well. Blackbird Blackbird was a pleasant opener for the evening (I didn't get there in time for Al Lover.) but didn't blow me away. It might have been that the Rickshaw was pretty empty during his set. Overall, this was my top pick for the inaugural Levitation Vancouver music festival, and it lived up to my expectations.

###### [King Tuff](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0uI2HyW0eIbTbyH3S2XDHI) + [Dead Ghosts](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3p0vuGnsU3JN0ZVBLiJwmp) + [Cosmonauts](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5fdHAaz0jnb4l2VEoHh5rb) + [The Courtneys](https://thecourtneys.bandcamp.com/track/social-anxiety) - 7 June 2015 (Sun.) at the Rickshaw (Levitation Vancouver Burger Records Showcase)

This was my other pick for Levitation. I didn't want to get a full pass nor go to Malkin Bowl during the two weekend days. I was originally planning on going to the Tobacco show only until The Courtneys announced that they were opening for the [Burger Records](http://www.burgerrecords.org/) showcase. The Rickshaw was pretty empty during The Courtneys' set. They played 3 (I think.) new tracks off their upcoming sophomore LP, but I didn't enjoy the set as much (probably because of the empty crowd). I'm excited for the new (The) Courtneys album, but holy Cosmonauts! They saved the night with their set. I wish I had gotten a button from them at least. I need to listen to their music more. King Tuff and Dead Ghosts were just OK for me. I'm glad I left during King Tuff's set to catch up on some much needed sleep.  

###### Up Next! - 2015 W24

<p class="list-description">It's a chill post- Levition / Music Waste week, BUT No Joy are finally back with their third LP and tour! They are probably my favourite Montr√©al band. I can't wait to pick up the deluxe LP later today (very hopefully?) and see them live on Thursday!</p>

  * [No Joy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U5LWokfRHY) + [Gang Signs](https://gangxsigns.bandcamp.com/) + [Village](http://villagevillage.bandcamp.com/track/stranger-thoughts-2) - 11 June 2015 (Thurs.) at The Biltmore

Go see No Joy! <i class="twa twa-lg twa-no-good"></i><i class="twa twa-lg twa-joy"></i>
