###### [Speedy Ortiz](https://speedyortiz.bandcamp.com/track/raising-the-skate) + [Alex G](https://orchidtapes.bandcamp.com/track/cards) + [Dead Soft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z931R_1cEQQ) - 26 May 2015 (Tues.) at The Cobalt

Speedy Ortiz played [La Sala Rossa](http://lasalarossa.com/) after their ['Major Arcana'](https://speedyortiz.bandcamp.com/album/major-arcana) album came out back in 2013, but I missed them, because I was at the [Emily Reo](https://emilyreo.bandcamp.com/track/wind) house show in Seattle. I think there were 3 other shows in Montréal I could have gone to that night. How do I even remember all of this? Anyway, this was the first show during which I was wearing my earplugs the entire time. The Cobalt is generally a loud venue, and Dead Soft are not dead soft. Alex G were the best of the night, as I expected them to be, but they didn't play [Cards](https://orchidtapes.bandcamp.com/track/cards), my favourite of their songs. Speedy Ortiz were good but didn't blow me away. I honestly thought that no other track stood out other than [Raising the Skate](https://speedyortiz.bandcamp.com/track/raising-the-skate).

###### [Owen Pallett](https://open.spotify.com/track/7HOUmHMzQ1wyNlRksUrmzn) + Gang Signs - 28 May 2015 (Thurs.) at The Biltmore

This was a free show, thanks to [Bestival Toronto](http://www.bestival.ca/) and Fido too, I guess. We hung out at [Jon Rogers Park](http://cfapp.vancouver.ca/parkfinder_wa/index.cfm?fuseaction=FAC.ParkDetails&park_id=137&CFID=690589&CFTOKEN=48300056) for a while and made it right on time for Owen Pallett. Despite the warnings of "limited tickets at the door" and "please show up early", The Biltmore was not that busy. Owen Pallett sounded better than what I remember from his set at La Sala Rossa last May. The disclaimer statements are that I drank more this time before the show, The Biltmore is smaller than Sala, so I was closer to the stage, and I was with like multiple friends. Owen Pallett played my favourites [In Conflict](https://open.spotify.com/track/7HOUmHMzQ1wyNlRksUrmzn) and [Soldiers Rock](https://open.spotify.com/track/2YRgMiTYkLxtqIFD1ihj6E) from his latest album 'In Conflict', as well as some of my other favourites, so I was a happy camper. We got hungry during [The Riverbed](https://open.spotify.com/track/7e49eApjEmDCHSYxElsHVB) and left after the song with our Fido Mason jars (I threw mine away...).

###### [Miami Horror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l971y5UUOxU) + DiRTY RADiO + De Lux - 30 May 2015 (Sat.) at the Owl

Simply put, I should have gone to see [Hop Along](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3yYUV3hkJit05YIUEODqgp) at The Cobalt next door after having the Finocchiona at [Farina](http://www.pizzeriafarina.com/). Miami Horror didn't go on until 12:30am, and I had to stay outside during DiRTY RADiO's set. De Lux were kind of (not really) interesting at the beginning of their set. I did enjoy [Real Slow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l971y5UUOxU) live and hanging out with new friends though.
