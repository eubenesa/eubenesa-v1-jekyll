###### [Gal Gracen](https://galgracen.bandcamp.com/track/--2) + [Whitney K](https://whitneyk.bandcamp.com/track/caught-in-the-headlights) + [Mesa Luna](https://soundcloud.com/mesaluna/sputnik) + [PLAZAS](https://soundcloud.com/plazasmusic/find-yourself) - 14 May 2015 (Thurs.) at 303 Columbia

One of the best Vancouver local shows in 2015 (so far) for me and one of my favourite nights here! There was a lot of hype about this show for me personally, and it certainly lived up to it. I had seen Mesa Luna live lucky times before, but I knew that 303 Columbia with good sound and a great crowd would be perfect, and it really was. It was their best set yet. I had so much fun! PLAZAS is an artist that I and many people in the Vancouver scene (hopefully) have been waiting for. She has her distinct sound, one that is different from [Grimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9XKLqGqwLA), [Mozart's Sister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCetxt9KoDs), [Pascale Project](https://soundcloud.com/pascaleproject/super-natural-1) (formerly [Math√©matique](https://soundcloud.com/stellarkinematics/mathematique-summer-but-i-dont)), et al. I smiled during her set a few times, which translates into chills and wows. Her future is much more exciting than her present! Whitney K and Gal Gracen chilled out the night after with their sweet sets. I think Whitney K are a grower for me, and it was great seeing Gal Gracen for the first time this year. I enjoyed them much more than when I saw them at the ANZA Club back in December. Thank yous to all the cool bands and special thank yous to [Happy Hour Radio](https://www.mixcloud.com/happyhourradioshow) for the presents! I wish I had gone to the first show (I went to see [Tycho](https://soundcloud.com/tycho/tycho-coastal-brake) that night.), but I am already stoked for the next event!
