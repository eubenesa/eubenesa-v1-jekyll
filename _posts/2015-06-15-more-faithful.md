###### [No Joy](https://soundcloud.com/mexicansummer/no-joy-hollywood-teeth) + [Gang Signs](https://gangxsigns.bandcamp.com/) + [Village](http://villagevillage.bandcamp.com/track/stranger-thoughts-2) - 11 June 2015 (Thurs.) at The Biltmore

I had been waiting for new material and tour from No Joy since December 2013, so of course I was getting stoked as the three new singles went live, the tour got announced, and the ['More Faithful'](https://open.spotify.com/album/7flLkHJhOpoYh8nuDve4RU) full album stream went up on Pandora and Exclaim!. 'More Faithful' is my favourite No Joy album so far. I feel like this album as a whole defines the No Joy sound and clicks with me more than ['Wait to Pleasure'](https://open.spotify.com/album/4hx78xxPOHBOpW04ruijFl) and ['Ghost Blonde'](https://open.spotify.com/album/4ggOmL8tAfuDxSt2LlvbGo) do. The newer sounds (including the ['Pastel And Pass Out'](https://open.spotify.com/album/0Qx3EQRNP5o95ZD4ZRLUof) EP) are brighter, a bit slower, more accessible, and still No Joy / shoegaze.

We got to The Biltmore on time for Gang Signs, since I didn't want to be late for No Joy. I have to admit that it's hard to get to shows for the opening bands these days, as the sunset hangs with friends at parks happen before them. Also, I had seen Village before, and I wasn't excited to see Gang Signs live. Their music sounds like The xx but duller to me. I was surprised but not that surprised that The Biltmore was pretty empty (Jasamine of No Joy did tell me that they don't get much crowd in Vancouver for some reason.). That didn't matter, thankfully. No Joy were as amazing as I remembered, and the ~5 songs from 'More Faithful' they played were great live. I loved watching Jasamine on her 'mission control centre', Laura and Michael being really into it on their guitar and bass, and Garland playing the drums like an animal in shorts and bare feet, all as before (even in the winter in Montr√©al) but with new material! They always play a shorter set than other bands normally play and without any words in between songs nor an encore. I think this keeps them very unique and exciting. You just don't get bored, move your head (and body for me) the whole time, and then ask for more but have to wait until next time. I knew I'd be buying their new t-shirt before the show, and I did. <i class="twa twa-lg twa-v"></i>

###### [No Joy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdkZ0pjS8qc) + [Appendixes](https://appendixes.bandcamp.com/) + [Tender Age](http://tenderage.bandcamp.com/) - 12 June 2015 (Fri.) at [Mississippi Studios](http://www.mississippistudios.com/), Portland, OR

No Joy didn't play my favourite song [Ghost Blonde](https://open.spotify.com/track/4Y1l9FDPBZTrJrNwTncawf) the night before. I wasn't disappointed about it, but I popped the question to both Jasamine and Laura, "If I'm at the Portland show tomorrow, will you guys play Ghost Blonde?" They responded, "Don't do that! Don't you have better things to do? We suck. We'll be back in the fall, opening for a band that we know you'll want to see. But, if you're there tomorrow, we'll play it." So, I started thinking about it that night. I got to work the next day as usual and contemplated more for good two hours. My friends were supportive, and I wanted to drive down to Portland for Ghost Blonde without any regrets, so I bought and printed my ticket for the show, biked home from work, picked up my passport, bus'ed and Skytrain'ed to the airport for a rental car, and started driving. It took me seven hours to get there, thanks to the traffic near Seattle and Tacoma, but I got there on time for Tender Age after an amazing falafel at [Wolf and Bear's](http://www.eatwolfandbears.com/).

Both Tender Age and Appendixes were just okay for me, as I was exhausted from <s>driving</s> traffic. I had my earplugs on the whole time until No Joy and sat upstairs during Appendixes' set. I really needed a rest. Everyone except Laura saw me before the set, and Michael offered to put me on the guest list, so my hopes were high for Ghost Blonde. And, it was a magical night for me! It was the same set as the Biltmore set but with Ghost Blonde after [Lizard Kids](https://open.spotify.com/track/5FggmwB9q0WU6LoCa4Bwpt). Laura gave me a look when they were starting to play the song, and it was the best Ghost Blonde I've heard live even though they hadn't played it for a year and half. I can't believe they actually played it for me! Also, the sound and crowd were better, probably because Mississippi Studios is an awesome venue. The drive back to Vancouver after was more exhausting but shorter and worth it. I'm already stoked to see No Joy in the fall!
