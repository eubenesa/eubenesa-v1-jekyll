The first sounds I am listening to while writing this post: [소리박물관 (Sori Museum)](https://sorimuseum.bandcamp.com)

###### [Seoul](https://soundcloud.com/seoulmtl/stay-with-us) + [Ballet School](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6dyWpK4qjCSoIvuOLXdjTv) + [Mu](https://soundcloud.com/soundsofmu/to-me-to-you) (V) - 5 May 2015 (Tues.) at The Media Club
Show of the week for me. I danced right at the stage the whole time that I had no time to take any pics. Seoul's set sounded more polished than when I saw them last spring back in Montréal. I'm stoked about their upcoming first LP next month. And, Ballet School and Mu danced with me during the set! Ballet School were a really fun band from Berlin, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of Mu around the citayyy.

###### [Agor](https://soundcloud.com/bluehawaii/3-get-happy-edit) (Blue Hawaii) DJ Set - 6 May 2015 (Wed.) at The Projection Room
This was a last minute surprise dj set that I found out about around 2pm the day of. I was super excited about it, since the last time I saw him, it was a $5 live set back in 2013 with [Miracle Fortress](https://soundcloud.com/secretcityrecords/let-me-be-the-one) and [NONI WO](https://noniwo.bandcamp.com/track/cheap-suit) at Drones Club. It was one of my favourite Montréal nights ever even though the cops came in and halted the happenings at 2am. However, this night was a letdown, as I only stayed for one can of the Old Style. It was just before the weather got early summer warm, my friend was feeling under the weather, and I wasn't getting the similar vibes.

###### [Dan Deacon](https://soundcloud.com/dan-deacon/feel-the-lightning) - 7 May 2015 (Thurs.) at Electric Owl
Dan Deacon was supposed to be the highlight of the week. I had been listening to the new Gliss Riffer album since it went up on NPR First Listen back in February. I had watched his [NPR Tiny Desk Concert](http://www.npr.org/event/music/387754703/dan-deacon-tiny-desk-concert) and [Boiler Room](http://boilerroom.tv/recording/dan-deacon/) sets. I had free beers before the show. I was ready. But really, I thought he sort of overdid all his tracks. In fact, I thought his 'smaller' set on KEXP the next day was way better. Maybe it was the sound at the Owl. Maybe Dan is a studio guy for me. Who knows.

###### [National Drone Day](http://droneday.org/about) - 9 May 2015 (Sat.) at Remington Gallery and Studio
Saturday was the second annual National Drone Day. My second knowing about it. My first checking it out. I saw 2 1/2 sets: [prOphecy sun](https://soundcloud.com/prophecy-sun) + LBS + [connect_icut](https://soundcloud.com/connect_icut) (the half) and thought that prOphecy sun treated the audience with a great set and performance. I'm usually not into drone music, but I was dedicated to check it out this year. Plus, it's amazing that this is an annual Canada-wide community-oriented thing.

###### [Shubaloo Launch Party](http://shubaloo.com) - 9 May 2015 (Sat.) at Studio East
Let's just say that I am thankful for my earplugs and the 5-6 local craft beers I had for $6. Everything on the main stage was really loud, but it was fun to see friends from different scenes and a great turnout. Congrats and best of luck to Shubaloo.

###### Up Next! - 2015 W20
Super stoked about seeing my buds [Mesa Luna](https://mesaluna.bandcamp.com/track/shutting-down) play 303 Columbia on Thursday ([link](https://www.facebook.com/events/891187774276039))! My friend says homies before music, but this is where I can definitely get both. [PLAZAS](https://soundcloud.com/plazasmusic/find-yourself) plays her very first show, and [the happy hour radio show](https://www.mixcloud.com/happyhourradioshow/sup-spring-happy-hour-radio-show-3-2015) are dope. See you there!
