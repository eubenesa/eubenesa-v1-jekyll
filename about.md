###### 안녕하세요, my name is Eubene.

It is like Eugene but with a b! I am a web developer currently based in Vancouuuver, Beautiful English Colombia, Canaja. I love working with UI/UX designers and being creative with turning design mockups into working code. Code! The web! Woo!

I started building this blog, because my newer nicer cooler East Van friends convinced me to, and I go to a shit ton of shows (I even keep a list of them [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sm51NQc2f9ElJIwrESF91ND8c9cI2sAiatMpddoRTAU/edit?usp=sharing)!). Apparently, I know a few things about the local music scene?

Anyway, I am hoping to write short things about the shows I am going to, the music I am listening to, and some travel stuff that is related to music. If you want to _learn more_, you can see myself online on those social things below or you can send me an electronic mail ([eubene.sa@gmail.com](mailto:eubene.sa@gmail.com?Subject=Hello%20Eubene!)). As [Dada Plan](http://dadaplan.ca/) say, see yourself online~!
